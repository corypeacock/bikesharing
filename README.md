## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide actionable data for a potential
startup company in Des Moines, IA. The idea is to learn from CitiBike in New
York City, utilizing the data that they have provided, and to learn from their
metrics in order to replicate their success. In analyzing CitiBike's data, we
can see when, where, and who rents their bikes. This understanding will allow
our company to prepare for those types of demographics as we purchase bikes and
place them around our lovely Des Moines, ready for rental.
